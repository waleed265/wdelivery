This web app demonstrates using asynchronous servlet techniques to reduce server resources.

The code for this tutorial is [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/java-docs-samples/tree/master/flexible/async-rest).


## Initial Setup ##

First, complete the following steps:

- [Create your project](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/managed-vms/) and have it enabled for Managed VMs.
- Obtain an app key for the Google Places WebService API.
- Download and install [the Beta build of the Google Cloud SDK](https://developers.google.com/cloud/sdk/#Quick_Start).
- Install the Cloud SDK `app-engine-java` component.
- Authenticate wth the gcloud SDK: gcloud auth application-default login.
- Install [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) if you haven't already.


## Providing your Google Places API key ##

To run locally, you need to edit the pom.xml file and replace YOUR_PLACES_APP_KEY with the value of your key:

    <places.appkey>YOUR_PLACES_APP_KEY</places.appkey>

To deploy to gcloud, you need to edit the src/main/appengine/app.yaml file and replace YOUR_PLACES_APP_KEY with the value of your key:

    PLACES_APPKEY: 'YOUR_PLACES_APP_KEY'


## Running locally without the AppEngine environment ##

The application does not use any AppEngine specific services, so you can run it simply on your local machine by doing:

     mvn jetty:run

Go to  http://localhost:8080 to see the webapp.


## Deploying to the cloud as an AppEngine ManagedVM ##

To automatically stage and deploy the webapp to your project in the cloud do:

    mvn clean package appengine:deploy
